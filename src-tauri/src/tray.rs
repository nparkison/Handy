//! System tray icon and menu.
//!
//! The tray is driven by a single *desired state* snapshot ([`TrayDesired`])
//! that callers update through [`set_tray_state`], [`refresh_tray_icon`] and
//! [`update_tray_menu`]. Every such call just records intent and schedules a
//! single applier on the main thread, which diffs the desired snapshot against
//! what is currently displayed and touches the native tray only for the parts
//! that actually changed. Requests that arrive while an apply is pending are
//! coalesced into it, so bursts of state changes never queue up native work.
//!
//! Why: native tray updates are the lever we control for the macOS tray
//! disappearance bug (tauri-apps/tauri#12060, Handy #1948). Before this, every
//! recording cycle rebuilt the full menu 3-6 times from several threads, and
//! concurrent rebuilds could interleave and leave a stale menu behind.
//!
//! Exception: [`set_tray_visibility`] and [`recreate_tray_icon`] call the tray
//! directly. Visibility is a separate attribute that never participates in the
//! icon/menu diff, both are rare and user-initiated, and Tauri marshals them
//! onto the main thread so they serialize with the applier anyway. Re-showing
//! a hidden tray relies on tray-icon recreating it from the last applied
//! icon/menu/tooltip, so those must only ever be set through the applier.
